Build a Reusable Comment Component

In this assignment, you’ll practice defining your own HTML elements by creating a reusable comment element. Reusable elements, sometimes called components or widgets, are an important part of sustainability building large applications, and comments are a great way to practice that as they are all structured similarly with different content. You’ll be defining the comment element with attributes to take in the content, you create an unlimited number of identically structured and styled comments with different content, and placing them by hand in your HTML.

To complete the assignment, please do the following:
1. Create a new local project that uses Vite, Prettier, and ESLint
2. Build a reusable comment component that meets these requirements:
     a. Uses Custom Elements
     b. Can take a name, email address, and comment as an attribute
     c. Display the name, email address, and attribute, in a custom layout that’s built-in to the component
3. Add 3-5 comment components to the page via HTML
4. The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the web page should be separate files. Use JavaScript module syntax (ES Modules) for your JavaScript. HTML and CSS defined as part of a custom element do not need to be in a separate file.
5. Submit your code by pushing it to GitHub, ensuring that there are no Prettier or ESLint errors.
